    text: "What is the GEOSS Portal?",
    content: `The is an online map-based user interface which allows users to discover and access Earth observation data and resources from different providers from all over the world. \n
The portal is implemented and operated by the European Space Agency and provides a single internet discovery and access point to the ever-growing quantities of heterogeneous collections of Earth observations from satellites, airplanes, drones and in-situ sensors at global, regional and local scales through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).`,

    text: "What is GEOSS?",
    content: `The GEOSS Platform, was created to provide the technological tool to implement the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). GEOSS is a social and software ecosystem sharing independent and open Earth observation (EO) information and processing services. It connects and coordinates a large array of observing systems, data systems, and processing services to strengthen monitoring of the state of the Earth. It facilitates the sharing of environmental data and information collected by countries and organizations within the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). GEOSS facilitates data and information accessibility and interoperability to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda, the Paris agreement and the Disaster Risk Reduction framework.`,

    text: "What is GEOSS Platform",
    content: `It is the cornerstone around which the GEOSS software ecosystem is implemented. The GEOSS Platform is the “glue-ware” that enables the connection and coordination of the many autonomous and multi-organizational systems and services contributing to GEOSS. The GEOSS Platform is composed by: the GEOSS Portal, the GEO DAB, the GEOSS Yellow pages and the GEOSS Service Status Checker.
The GEO Discovery and Access Broker (GEO DAB) is the primary mechanism by which all data and information is discovered and accessed. The GEO DAB implements the necessary mediation and harmonization services through Application Program Interfaces (APIs). These APIs allow data providers to share resources without having to make major changes to their technology or standards.
The GEOSS Yellow pages service implements the simplified registration process for new Data Providers.
The GEOSS Service Status Checker is the component, developed by USGS/FGDC and integrated into the GEO DAB, which aims at improving user experience by providing information on Reliability of Services. The Status Checker is an automatic mechanism to monitor, diagnose and alert data providers and users on the Health status of the web services provided by the GEOSS Platform.
In addition to the above described main components of the Platform, GEOSS offers the so-called Reuse Components to serve the specificities of the various user communities. This means that user communities, which might have their own data, portals and corresponding specific needs, can reuse some of the GEOSS Platform components customized and tailored to their specific requirements.
They are components that can be used by developers of the communities. They are listed below:
    •	The GEOSS View, which provides access to a subset of specifically defined GEOSS resources using temporal, thematic and spatial criteria;
    •	The GEOSS APIs, which expose the discovery and access functionalities of the GEO DAB and as such can be exploited by user communities client applications or portals;
    •	The GEOSS Mirror is a GEOSS Portal site customization for SBAs, Flagships, Initiatives, and Communities. The customization better serves the specific community interests by filtering catalogues and search results by a specific theme or GEO DAB view, location of interest, etc.;
The GEOSS Widget is a freely-available instantiation of selected GEOSS Portal widgets made available for possible customization in various areas of application (e.g. a specific SBA, Initiatives, etc.). This is accomplished by publishing portal code parts (widgets) wrapped up in API.`,
