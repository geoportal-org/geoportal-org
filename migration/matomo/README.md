Migration plan from Google Analytics to Matomo.

Google Analytics data will be imported to its own website in Matomo, and future data will be track to a separate website. This means you can setup tracking first, and have a GA import running in the background to store your historical GA data. The GA Importer requires no special steps to support this use case. You can simply set up your import, which will create a separate website in Matomo and import data to it. You can use any other existing or new website in Matomo to track new data to.
